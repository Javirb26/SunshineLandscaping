          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            When Hurricane Ian swept through Florida, many homeowners were left with fallen trees, blocked driveways, and nowhere to turn. That’s when Henry and the Sunshine Landscaping team stepped up—offering free tree-cutting and cleanup services to affected families across the Tampa Bay area.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            For us, landscaping isn’t just a business—it’s a way to support the people around us. That spirit of generosity continues to guide our work today.
